# 🌿 Internship Projects Repository

Welcome to my internship projects repository! This repo includes various projects, databases, and documentation developed during my internship at ENSFEA. The main focus was on creating an autonomous device for detecting and recognizing wild plants, especially orchids.

## 📂 What's Inside

### 1. 🤖 - Machine Learning Model
- **Teachable Machine**: Experiments and models created using Google's Teachable Machine.

### 2. 🍓 - Raspberry Pi Development
- **RPi5-flower-detection**: Image recognition software running on Raspberry Pi 5. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Encila/RPi5-flower-detection)
- **VideoRecorder**: Program for capturing and processing video footage from Raspberry Pi cameras. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Encila/VideoRecorder)

### 3. 🛠️ - Device Construction
- **Design and Fabrication**: 3D-printed components and laser-cut enclosures for the portable device.

### 4. 📜 - Documentation
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed technical documents and recommendations for future improvements.

### 5. 📚 - Databases
- ~~**Infrared (IR) Database**: Collection of infrared images used for training and testing.~~
- **Visible Light Database**: Collection of visible light images used for training and testing.

## 🚀 Installation

To install the projects, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Encila/wild_flowers_project.git
```

## ❌ Project Status

Unfortunately, the project couldn't be fully realized due to the poor quality of the Module 3 Camera. This issue prevented us from achieving the desired accuracy in detecting and recognizing wild plants. Further explanations and detailed assessments will be provided in [this README file](/📚%20-%20Databases/README.md) and in the [documentation part](/📜%20-%20Documentation/).
