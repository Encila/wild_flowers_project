# üõ†Ô∏è Device Construction

Welcome to the Device Construction folder. This directory provides information on the design and assembly of an autonomous and transportable device for detecting and recognizing wild plants.

## Contents

This folder includes files and instructions to help you recreate the device. The goal is to build a portable unit containing a Raspberry Pi 5, power banks, cameras, and a touchscreen.

## Construction Process

### Materials and Components
- **Raspberry Pi 5**
- **Power Banks**
- **Cameras**
- **Touchscreen**
- **Medium 6mm (MDF)**
- **Velcro Tape**
- **3D Printed Parts**
- **Glue**

### Design and Assembly

1. **Box Design**:
   - We designed the box using [boxes.py](https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de/UniversalBox?language=fr), an online tool for creating customizable box designs. The design includes specific cutouts for the touchscreen and camera cables.

2. **Cutting the Box**:
   - The box was cut using a laser cutter. We used 6mm medium-density fiberboard (MDF) for the construction. The laser cutter ensured precise cuts for the box components.

3. **Touchscreen and Camera Integration**:
   - A hole was cut in the box for the touchscreen, allowing it to fit snugly. Another hole was made for the camera cable to pass through.
   - We created a protective belt for the touchscreen and glued it around the edges to secure it.

4. **Power Banks**:
   - Velcro tape was attached inside the box and on the power banks. This allows for easy removal and recharging of the power banks while keeping them securely in place during operation.

5. **Camera Holder**:
   - The camera holder was 3D printed and designed using Fusion 360. This piece holds the camera securely in position.

6. **Assembly**:
   - All components were assembled inside the box. The Raspberry Pi 5, power banks, cameras, and touchscreen were fitted into their designated positions.
   - The box was then closed, with all cables managed neatly through the provided cutouts.

### Photos
To help you visualize the device, we have included photos that show various stages of the assembly and the final product. These photos can provide a clearer understanding of how to put the device together.

### Improvement Options

To enhance the device, consider the following options:

1. **Add Handlers**: Install handlers on the sides of the box for easier carrying.
2. **Add a Strap**: Attach a strap to make the device more portable and easier to transport.
3. **Choose Different Materials**: Consider using lighter materials such as plastic or aluminum to reduce the overall weight of the device.
4. **Choose Lightweight Power Banks**: Opt for lightweight power banks to minimize the weight of the device.
5. **Make it Higher to Add a Lid**: Design the box to be higher and include a lid for better protection and accessibility.
6. **Protect the Cameras**: Add protective housings for the cameras to prevent damage and ensure longevity.

### Main Issue

The primary issue with the current design is the weight of the device. Implementing the above improvement options can help reduce the weight and make the device more practical for field use.

### Files

This folder includes files that can help you recreate the box and its components:
- **Box Design File**: The design file from boxes.py for the box construction.
- **3D Print File**: The model file for the 3D printed camera holder.

## Conclusion

By following these instructions and using the provided files, you can recreate the autonomous and transportable device designed during the project. This device integrates all necessary components into a compact and portable unit, making it ideal for fieldwork in plant detection and recognition.
